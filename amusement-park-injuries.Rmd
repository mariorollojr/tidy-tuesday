How many people have been injured over time?

```{r}
safer_parks %>%
  group_by(acc_month) %>%
  summarise(injured = sum(num_injured, na.rm = TRUE)) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = acc_month, y = injured)) +
  geom_col()
```

What are the seasonal trends? Are more people being injured as time goes on?

```{r}
safer_parks %>%
  mutate(year = year(acc_date),
         month = month(acc_date, label = TRUE)) %>%
  group_by(year, month) %>%
  summarise(injured = sum(num_injured, na.rm = TRUE)) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = year, y = injured)) +
  geom_line(col = "dark blue", size = 2) +
  expand_limits(y = 0) +
  facet_wrap(~ month, scales = "free_y") +
  labs(title = "Are more people being injured in amusement parks over time?",
       x = "",
       y = "Total Number of People Injured")
```

Injury counts seem to be getting higher over time, with consistent increases across months.


Where are these accidents taking place?

```{r}
safer_parks %>%
  mutate(bus_type = fct_lump(bus_type, 6)) %>%
  count(bus_type) %>%
  mutate(bus_type = fct_reorder(bus_type, n)) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = bus_type, y = n, fill = bus_type)) +
  geom_col() +
  coord_flip() +
  scale_fill_viridis(discrete = TRUE, direction = -1) +
  scale_y_continuous(label = comma_format()) +
  theme(legend.position = "none") +
  labs(title = "Where are accidents taking place?",
       x = "",
       y = "Number of Accidents")
```
